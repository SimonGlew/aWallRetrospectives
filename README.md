# aWallRetrospectives
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg?cacheSeconds=2592000)

This application was my final year honours project at Victoria University. It is an application that facilitates Agile retrospectives using a large touch screen device as a hub, and mobile  phones as secondary input to create a more immersive, user friendly experience. It can be seen running on [here](https://awall.herokuapp.com/ "aWall: Retrospectives (Heroku)") and my final report can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3j82ymbonhdfi19/Agile_Wall__Collaboration_Support_for_Agile_Retrospectives.pdf?dl=0 "aWall: Retrospectives (Report)").
