\begin{abstract}

Agile does not have an online tool that allows integration to different online tools and allowing users to use this integration when participating in agile retrospectives. It is a problem as it means either the team has to be co-located or use the addition of different third-party applications such as Skype. By creating and integrating online retrospective tools within aWall will allow users to participate in agile retrospectives online within the tool. This report outlines the overall project that was carried out including the planning, implementation and evaluation of the tool.
