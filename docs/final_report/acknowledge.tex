\chapter*{Acknowledgments}\label{C:ack} 
I would like to thank my supervisor Dr Craig Anslow for his advice and mentorship over the course of this project. I would also like to thank Professor Martin Kropp from FHNW in Switzerland for allowing me to build upon a previous prototype that some of his students had built. Finally, I would like to thank the Human-Computer Interaction group at Victoria University who always helped with advice and assistance when required.
