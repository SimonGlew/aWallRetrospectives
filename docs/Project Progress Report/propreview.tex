\chapter{Proposal Review}\label{C:propreview}
A review of the proposal that was submitting has found that the plan for the project has had to be re-evaluated in terms of its project time line. 
\section{Changes}
The changes to the project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Time:} The initial timeline of the project was to have nearly all development finished by the middle of June, this goal is now unreachable, so a new timeline has been put in place. 
The development on the prototype will now be finished by the 27th July. This doesn't affect the rest of the timeline planned for the second trimester of work as that was planned to start in August of 2018.
\end{itemize}
