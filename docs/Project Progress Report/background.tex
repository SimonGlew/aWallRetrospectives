Retrospectives are meetings held within agile teams, involving all members of the team and is held at the end and just after an iteration of work \cite{AgileRetrospectivesEstherDerby,GettingValueFromRetrospectives}. The retrospective is used for not only celebrating the success of work from the last retrospective, but also the failures and lessons that can be learnt from them \cite {normanKeith}. The retrospective is normally facilitated by a third party member who does not have a personal stake in the in the content or outcome of the meeting, therefore being able to remain neutral during the meeting \cite{normanKeith,retrospectiveFacilator}. Retrospectives are used to reflect on the work done since the last retrospective and the problems that the team faced within this work. \cite{AgileRetrospectivesEstherDerby}. aWall is a online tool that allows for collaboration within a team when it comes to agile practices \cite{xp2017_aWall}, including the aqile practice of retrospectives. With the tool being online, it allows teams to seperate members while still all members can include thoughts and feelings to the agile practices within the team.
