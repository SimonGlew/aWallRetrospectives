\chapter{Evaluation of Solution}\label{C:evalution}
The solution is going to be evaluated through User Studies. A ethics proposal has been submitted to the Human Ethics Committee within Victoria and is currently going through the process of being evaluated and approved, the ethics application number is \textit{\#0000026187}. 
\section{Process}
The process for the user study will consist of the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Users will volunteer and be placed into groups or 'teams' to do the retrospectives in.
\item The teams will firstly participate within a 'control' retrospective, where they will do part of a retrospective the old way, using a cardwall.
\item The teams will then participate in a retrospective using the aWall tool using one of the 4 main retrospective methods
\item Finally the members within each of the teams will fill out a questionnaire about the experience, the questionnaire can been seen in the Appendices as Appendix One. 
\end{itemize}

Using the data gathered from the questionnaires and from the observations within the user study, I will be able to not only evaluate the success of using a touch wall over a card wall, but also what retrospective method has the greatest engagement within different software teams.
